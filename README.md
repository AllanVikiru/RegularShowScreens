# Regular Show Screens
A [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/RegularScreens) that generates screenshots of Regular Show every half hour. 

The homepage of this [site](https://regularshowscreens.wordpress.com) serves as a repo of the images.

Essentially used 2 libraries: [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to fetch the screens in fetch.py and [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/) to send out tweets in tweet.py

### Feel free to send in any contributions and queries. Cheers!
